# Ai Downloader

A python file downloader with a QT GUI.

This app was almost entirely written by OpenAI Codex. I made some very small changes to finish it out(such as adding a icon).

It was intended as an experiment to see if I could make a fully functioning application written in python using AI, which worked wonders as it was already running out of the prompt result.

## App icon

The app icon was also made using AI. Specifically Stable Diffusion.
