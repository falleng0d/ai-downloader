# Ai Downloader

A python file downloader with a QT GUI.

This app was almost entirely written by OpenAi Codex, but I have made some changes to improve it just a little bit.

It was intended to as a experiment to see if I could make a full functioning app in python using AI, which worked wonders as it was fully running out of the prompt result.

The app icon was also made using AI. Specifically Stable Diffusion.
